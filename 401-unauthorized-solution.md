# 401 Unauthorized Issues Analysis

Based on the code review, there are several potential issues that could be causing the 401 Unauthorized errors:

1. **Missing Access Token Generation**: In `auth.service.ts`, the `login` method generates a refresh token but doesn't generate an access token. The client needs both tokens - the refresh token for getting new access tokens and the access token for API calls.

2. **Token Validation**: The `JwtStrategy` doesn't have proper error handling in the validate method, which could lead to silent failures.

3. **Token Extraction**: The JWT strategy is configured to extract tokens from the Authorization header using Bearer scheme, make sure your client is sending the token correctly in this format: `Authorization: Bearer <your_token>`

## Recommended Solutions

1. Update the login method in `auth.service.ts` to generate and return both tokens:

```typescript
async login(user: IUser, response: Response) {
    const { _id, name, email, role } = user;
    const payload = {
        sub: "token login",
        iss: "from server",
        _id, name, email, role
    };
    
    // Generate both tokens
    const accessToken = this.jwtService.sign(payload, {
        expiresIn: this.configService.get<string>("JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE"),
        secret: this.configService.get<string>("JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN")
    });
    const refreshToken = this.createRefreshToken(payload);
    
    // Update refresh token in database
    await this.usersService.updateUserToken(refreshToken, _id);
    
    // Set refresh token as httpOnly cookie
    response.cookie('refresh_token', refreshToken, {
        httpOnly: true,
        maxAge: ms(this.configService.get<string>("JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE"))
    });
    
    // Return access token in response body
    return {
        access_token: accessToken
    };
}
```

2. Update the JWT strategy validate method with better error handling:

```typescript
async validate(payload: any) {
    try {
        const { _id, name, email, role } = payload;
        if (!_id || !email) {
            throw new UnauthorizedException('Invalid token payload');
        }
        return { _id, name, email, role };
    } catch (error) {
        throw new UnauthorizedException('Token validation failed');
    }
}
```

3. Client-side checks:
   - Ensure you're including the access token in the Authorization header
   - Format should be: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
   - Don't send the refresh token in headers (it should be handled automatically as an httpOnly cookie)
   - Check if your access token hasn't expired

4. Additional tips:
   - Use the @Public() decorator for routes that don't require authentication
   - Monitor token expiration and use the refresh token to get a new access token before it expires
   - Make sure your JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN secret is properly set in your environment variables
